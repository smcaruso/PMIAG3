A typical 793 Large Mining Truck can haul 255 tons (US) and weighs over 851,000 lbs. Using battery electric technology to move this size truck with payload is a first for Caterpillar. Many of our customers have bold emissions reduction goals and Caterpillar is committed to enabling and supporting our customers’ goals. A battery enabled machine does not run on a diesel engine, hence there are no exhaust emissions which is significant step in supporting our customers’ sustainable mining journeys.","The team successfully demonstrated the completed prototype battery electric 793 Large Mining Truck at the Tucson Proving Ground facility on November 14, 2022 and received wide publicity. Several customers came together to witness the live demonstration of the prototype truck’s capabilities on a seven-kilometer (4.3-mile) course."],"images":[{"imageFilename":"Exec Summary 1_ Battery Electric 793 Protoytpe..JPG","imageCaption":"Caterpillar Prototype 793 Battery Electric Mining Truck"},{"imageFilename":"Exec Summary 2_ Battery Electric 793 Detail..JPG","imageCaption":"793 Decal Closeup"},{"imageFilename":"Project Background 1_Group Photo at demonstration.jpg","imageCaption":"Group Photo at Demonstration"},{"imageFilename":"Project Background 2_Demonstration attendees.jpg","imageCaption":"Demonstration Attendees"}],"creditGrid":[{"creditName":"Vittal Anaantatmula, DSc, PMP","creditDescription":"Professor, Western Carolina University","creditLocation":"Cullowhee, North Carolina, USA"},{"creditName":"Frank Anbari, PhD, PMP","creditDescription":"Professor Emeritus, Drexel University","creditLocation":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA"}]}
