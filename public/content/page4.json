A new double circuit 230kV line segment was installed across Baltimore Harbor's active shipping channel and is supported by some of the tallest transmission monopoles in North America. Due to the significance of the location of the electric infrastructure, Baltimore Gas and Electric launched this project to preserve the integrity of the transmission system and to ensure safe and reliable power delivery to its customers. Customers in the BGE service territory benefit from a more modern infrastructure that provides reliable power delivery across the state of Maryland while minimizing environmental impacts on the critical Chesapeake Bay area."],"images":[{"imageFilename":"Key Crossing_1 - Julie Ratcliffe (1).jpg","imageCaption":"Installing foundation pipe piles in the river."},{"imageFilename":"Key Crossing_2 - Julie Ratcliffe (1).jpg","imageCaption":"Setting precast concrete on the foundation piles"},{"imageFilename":"Key Crossing_3 - Julie Ratcliffe (1).jpg","imageCaption":"Steel pole erection."},{"imageFilename":"Key Crossing_4 - Julie Ratcliffe (1).png","imageCaption":"Helicopter stringing operations."},{"imageFilename":"Key Crossing_5 - Julie Ratcliffe (1).png","imageCaption":"Vessel collision protection construction."}],"creditGrid":[{"creditName":"Vittal Anaantatmula, DSc, PMP","creditDescription":"Professor, Western Carolina University","creditLocation":"Cullowhee, North Carolina, USA"},{"creditName":"Frank Anbari, PhD, PMP","creditDescription":"Professor Emeritus, Drexel University","creditLocation":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA"}]}
